# Animate position along the path in SwiftUI
In SwiftUI every animation would always take the shortest path. It is easy to imagine animating position along the infinite numbet of different path. Even if lack of this option is a design choice, I think that implementing a right modifier would fit SwiftUI paradigm.

# 
The first draft of code and the demo are just to ilustrate the concept.

Qestions and choices:
- with the clear goal, what would be the right way to tackle the problem?
- what are main flaws in the first draft (firstDraft.swift)
- are there obvious errors?
- with animation applied only to change of position, should it rather be made in less general way?
